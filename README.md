Comparison of indian_diabetes dataset using Keras Deep Learning Method with Logistic Regression

I would like to thank Jason Brownlee as he was the inspiration for me where he is using indian_diabetes dataset and explaining to determine the accuracy using Keras with the help of Deep Learning.

If you want to just check the article of how he did it.The link is being given below:

I just wanted to know the accuracy of indian_diabetes dataset using Logistic Regression and how much change is happening in the accuracy so I am posting my github code along with his code.
